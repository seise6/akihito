	<h1>The Warrior's Temple</h1>
	<p>Because Akihito is an old man he doesn't move any more than he has to. Despite being old, he is actually very agile and muscular. Because he was a samurai back in his hay day, the Professor is well versed in combat and gives off an intense yet experienced vibe as his presence takes control of a room he is in.</p>

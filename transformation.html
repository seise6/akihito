	<h1>Akihito's Legacy</h1>
	<p>Although he looks like just some old kook stranded up in his makeshift camp, Professor Akihito is actually a living legend to the people of his world in terms of combat. He once single-handedly took out and entire clan in the midst of a war. Villagers to this day sing songs about him but do not know if he is alive or not.</p>
